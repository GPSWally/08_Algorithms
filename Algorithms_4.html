	<div>
		<p>Write a JavaScript program which prompts the user for a number and console.logs that number as a string with dashes (-) between each two odd digits. For example if the user types 0253697 the output should be “025-369-7”.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Input number was <span id='input'></span>.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Output number is <span id="output"></span>.</p>

		//The long way of doing it.  I did this to practice working with arrays and push...

		var numEnt = prompt("Enter a number with at least 6 digits"); // Enter the number
		var numArr = numEnt.split(""); //Split the digits into an array

		document.getElementById('input').innerHTML = numEnt //Display the inputted number


		var secondDig = 0; //create a variable to hold the second digit of the number.
		var firstDig = parseInt(numArr[0]); //load the first digit as a number.
		var newNum = firstDig+"";//converts firstDig from a number to a character & loads the first digit into the new number.

		//Array to work through each digit of the number entered.
		for (var i=1; i<numEnt.length; i++){
			secondDig = parseInt(numArr[i]); //load the second digit as a number
			
			//Determine if 2 digits are odd and add a - if they are place a - between them.
			if ((secondDig % 2 === 1) && (firstDig % 2 === 1)){
				newNum = newNum + "-"
			}

			//Load all the digits into a new String
			newNum = newNum + secondDig;

			//Shift the digits to the next set of digits
			firstDig = secondDig;
		}

		document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = newNum; //Output the answer
